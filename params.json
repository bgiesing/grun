It otherwise behaves like any Chrome extension you'd download from the store. \r\n\r\n## Rights, etc.\r\n\r\nI obviously don't own the rights to Game of Thrones, and I'm not a representative of GRR, HBO, or any-one/thing else related to the production and distribution of Game of Thrones, either in print or television. \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
