###*the grunifying chrome extension*

####What Is It?

Grun is a Chrome extension that will, on the click of the extension icon, change every word into Grun, with randomly generated punctuation to keep it from getting too dull.

####How Do I Use It?

Since Grun isn't in the Chrome store, you need to download the extension, and in the extensions menu of Chrome, click "load unpacked extension" and select Grun's directory. It otherwise behaves like any Chrome extension you'd download from the store.

####Rights, Etc.

Grun is Spagoot's thinking but the character is from Pokemon.
